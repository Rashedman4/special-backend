# 🧠 TokenSphere Backend (Express + PostgreSQL)

This repository contains the **backend API** for TokenSphere - a small social platform where users can join communities, post updates, create polls and events, and transfer in‑app credits. The service is built with **Node.js**, **Express**, and **PostgreSQL** and exposes a JSON API for clients such as React apps or mobile clients to consume.

## 🏗️ Tech Stack

- **Node.js** with **Express** for the HTTP server
- **PostgreSQL** using the pg library for database access
- **dotenv**, **cors** and **morgan** for environment configuration, CORS handling and request logging
- Simple role‑based middleware (adminAuth.js) to guard administrative routes

## 🚀 Getting Started

- **Install dependencies**

- npm install

- **Create and initialise a PostgreSQL database** (e.g. tokensphere). A sample schema is provided in schema.sql; run it with psql or your favourite tool:

- createdb tokensphere  
   psql -d tokensphere -f schema.sql

- **Create a .env file** with your database connection string. For example:

- DATABASE_URL=postgres://postgres:password@localhost:5432/tokensphere  
   PORT=5000

- **Start the server**

- node server.js
- By default the API will run on <http://localhost:5000>.

## 🗂️ Project Structure

The server code is organised by route and by responsibility. Below is an overview of the key files:

project/  
├── routes/  
│ ├── auth.js # sign up & login  
│ ├── users.js # user listing and profile update  
│ ├── wallet.js # wallet and transactions  
│ ├── posts.js # posts, polls & events  
│ ├── communities.js # communities CRUD & join/leave  
│ └── admin/  
│ ├── overview.js # dashboard statistics (admin only)  
│ ├── community.js # admin community management  
│ └── users.js # admin user management  
├── middleware/  
│ └── adminAuth.js # simple admin role guard  
├── db.js # exports a configured pg client  
├── server.js # API entry point, mounts all routes  
└── schema.sql # database schema (tables & triggers)

Each route module exports an express.Router() instance which is mounted in server.js under a specific prefix. For example, posts.js is mounted at /api/posts, so its GET / handler corresponds to GET /api/posts.

Each item in the posts array has at least the following shape:

Depending on type, additional fields are included:

- **Polls**: question, ends_at, options (array of { id, text, votes }), total_votes, and user_vote (option ID or null).
- **Events**: title, description, start_date, end_date, location, attendees_count, and is_attending (boolean).

#### 🔸 POST /api/posts

- **Post** (type = "post" - default): requires content. The community_id may be null for public posts or set to a community ID.
- **Poll** (type = "poll"): requires question and an array of at least two poll_options (or options). Optional duration_hours (default 24) sets when the poll closes.
- **Event** (type = "event"): requires title, location, start_date (ISO string). Optional description, end_date and community_id.

Example request - creating a poll:

{

"question": "What's your favourite programming language?",  
"poll_options": \["JavaScript", "Python", "Go"\],

"community_id": null  
}

The response includes the newly created post (with empty votes for polls and zero attendees for events).

This README documents the available endpoints for the TokenSphere backend and should provide everything you need to get the API up and running locally. Feel free to expand it as you add more functionality!
